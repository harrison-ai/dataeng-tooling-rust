# This workflow automatically builds and publishes the docker image
# for every push to the `main` branch. We rely on branch protection
# to ensure that all changes to `main` have gone through a PR, and
# on the separate `tests` workflow to ensure that every PR properly
# increments the version info in a way that's safe to publish.
