# Test Project for Dockerized Rust Toolchain

This is a litte do-nothing Rust crate that has dependencies on a couple of the
known-to-be-fiddly Rust crates that we use in the wild. It's used as part of
the automated tests for this repo, to check whether the built docker images
can successfully compile things.
